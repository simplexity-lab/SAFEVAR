# LGSVL experiment

## Description

- [3_30_11](https://github.com/simplexity-lab/SAFEVAR/tree/main/LG/3_30_11) is our expanded LGSVL simulator 2021.1.
- [PythonAPI-master](https://github.com/simplexity-lab/SAFEVAR/tree/main/LG/PythonAPI-master) is the code of scenario designed in \lgsvl combined with the NSGA-II algorithm.
    - /quickstart contains main source code;
    - [/quickstart/NSGAII.py](https://github.com/simplexity-lab/SAFEVAR/blob/main/LG/PythonAPI-master/quickstart/NSGAII.py) is the program's entry point;
    - [/quickstart/lgsvl](https://github.com/simplexity-lab/SAFEVAR/tree/main/LG/PythonAPI-master/quickstart/lgsvl) includes the modified client API for LGSVL;
## Prerequisite
- Please ensure that you have one Windows computer and one Linux computer for the deployment of LGSVL emulator and Apollo, respectivelyï¼›
- Ensure that LGSVL and Apollo need to communicate on the same LAN;
